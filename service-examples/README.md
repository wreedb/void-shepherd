Service Examples
================

These can be used on their own (e.g. loaded from a services.d directory), or  
written directly into a users main system/user level shepherd configuration  
file. They are just examples; they may need tweaking for them to work properly  
in your environment, depending on file path/name differences between the many  
distributions.

## Contributing
If you would like to add an example of a service definition, open a pull  
request with any file(s) you'd like to add, of course separating services  
into the user and system folders respectively based on their usage.
